        Welcome! I am an Algerian Computer Science student at the University of Science and Technology of Oran.
        I am interested in coding, game development, and web development.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was born in Oran on July 13th 2006 and grew up interested in mathematics and science.
        My early exposure to computers naturally led me toward programming. At the age of 13 years old, I coded a Discord bot using the discord.js
        in the JavaScript programming language, then, I joined a Discord server
        called Fossbay, it was my home, I met so many cool people in it, this community
        led me to Linux, different programming languages and libraries and overall taught me a lot..
      </p>

      <p>
        Being interested in games, I tried getting into game development, tried Unity using C#, Godot using GDscript
        and so I learned a lot about graphics and game design I even made my own game called Minio, I then learned about Java
        and did some Object Oriented Programming in it, learned many new concepts to me like Encapsulation, Polymorphism and many more.
      </p>

      <p>
        I currently Am a 2nd year student at the University of Science and Technology of Oran and will be graduating my bachelors degree next year inshallah !
